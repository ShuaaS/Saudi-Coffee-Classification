# Saudi-Coffee-Classification  

 Saudi Coffee Beans Classification (Type and roasting) based on squeeze vision transformer.   

This repository contains the dataset alongside the codes written and implemented for the paper: 

_**“TEQHWA: Saudi Coffee Beans Classification Mobile Application based on squeeze vision transformer, Haifa F. Alhasson and Shuaa S. Alharbi 2024’’**_


# Dataset Distribution

We formed the data collected into three datasets based on the purpose needed
to be classified as follows:

**1- Saudi Coffee Types Dataset (SCTD):**
The main focus of this dataset is distinguishing between different genotypes of Saudi coffee (as a part of the Arabic
coffee genotypes), they have different morphology and size. This dataset contains 5 classes of Saudi coffee genotypes beans (Harari, Khawlani, Nabari,
Laqamti and Wild (Briah)). This dataset can be used to classify beans based ondifferences in the shape features of beans’ genotypes to evaluate and control
the quality of the traded coffee beans. 

**2- Saudi Coffee Roasting Dataset (SCRD)**
The main focus of this dataset is distinguishing between different roasting degrees of Saudi coffee based on the samples collected from the coffee market in Saudi Arabia. As we find out that there are 3 main roasting degrees in addition of the raw state of the bean. The beans can be identifiable by their colour. This dataset contains 4 classes of Saudi coffee genotypes beans (Raw, Degree 1, Degree 2 and Degree 3).

**3- Saudi Coffee Types and Roasting Dataset (SCTRD)**
This dataset combined two classes from the two as intercross datasets to form 20 classes.

The details the number of images in each categories can be found in this Table:
